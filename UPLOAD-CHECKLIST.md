# 📁 File Upload Checklist for GitHub

## ✅ Files to Upload to Your GitHub Repository

When you create your GitHub repository, upload ALL of these files:

### 📄 Root Files (upload directly to main folder):
```
✅ index.html              (Main website file)
✅ README.md               (Project documentation)  
✅ free-hosting-guide.md   (Hosting options guide)
✅ DEPLOY-GUIDE.md         (This deployment guide)
✅ UPLOAD-CHECKLIST.md     (This checklist)
```

### 📁 CSS Folder:
Create a folder called `css` and upload:
```
css/
  ✅ style.css             (All website styling)
```

### 📁 JS Folder:
Create a folder called `js` and upload:
```
js/
  ✅ script.js             (Interactive functionality)
```

### 📁 Images Folder (currently empty):
Create an `images` folder for future artwork:
```
images/
  (You'll add your artwork images here later)
```

## 🚀 Upload Process:

### Step 1: Create Repository
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) (already opening)
- Sign up/Sign in
- Create new repository named `yourusername.github.io`

### Step 2: Upload Root Files First
1. Click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag these files from `C:\Users\LENOVO\art-website\`:
   - `index.html`
   - `README.md`
   - `free-hosting-guide.md` 
   - `DEPLOY-GUIDE.md`
   - `UPLOAD-CHECKLIST.md`

### Step 3: Create CSS Folder
1. After uploading root files, click "Create new file"
2. Type `css/style.css` (this creates the folder automatically)
3. Copy content from `C:\Users\LENOVO\art-website\css\style.css`
4. Paste into the web editor
5. Commit the file

### Step 4: Create JS Folder
1. Click "Create new file" again
2. Type `js/script.js`
3. Copy content from `C:\Users\LENOVO\art-website\js\script.js`
4. Paste into the web editor  
5. Commit the file

### Step 5: Create Images Folder
1. Click "Create new file"
2. Type `images/.gitkeep` (this creates an empty folder)
3. Commit the file

## ⚡ Quick Upload Method:

### Option A: Drag & Drop Everything
1. Select ALL files and folders in `C:\Users\LENOVO\art-website\`
2. Drag them to the GitHub upload area
3. GitHub will maintain the folder structure automatically
4. Commit all changes at once

### Option B: Upload Folders Separately
Follow Steps 1-5 above for more control

## 🎯 After Upload:

1. **Enable Pages**: Go to Settings → Pages → Deploy from main branch
2. **Wait**: 5-20 minutes for first deployment
3. **Visit**: Your site at `https://yourusername.github.io`

## 📋 Final Structure Should Look Like:

```
yourusername.github.io/
├── index.html
├── README.md
├── free-hosting-guide.md
├── DEPLOY-GUIDE.md
├── UPLOAD-CHECKLIST.md
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   └── script.js
└── images/
    └── .gitkeep
```

## ❗ Important Notes:

- **Repository must be PUBLIC** for free GitHub Pages
- **Name must be exactly** `yourusername.github.io`
- **index.html** must be in the root folder (not in a subfolder)
- All file names are case-sensitive

## 🆘 If You Need Help:

1. Follow the detailed `DEPLOY-GUIDE.md`
2. Check GitHub's documentation
3. The entire process should take 10-15 minutes

**Your website is ready to go live! 🚀**
